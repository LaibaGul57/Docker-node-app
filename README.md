# Node Docker App

This is a simple Node.js web application that returns "Hello, Docker!" when accessed on web browser.  
It is containerized using Docker.

## ðŸ“¦ How to Build and Run the App

### 1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t node-docker-appÂ .




#   Task 02 Commands
docker ps â€“  this command show Lists  of all currently running containers.

docker stop â€“ this command stop my container from running stage.

docker rm â€“it  Removes my container.

docker logs â€“ Shows the logs (output) of a containerâ€™s process.

docker inspect â€“ Provides detailed info (JSON) about a container or image like network setting,cmd,global IPaddress etc.

docker exec â€“ Runs a command inside a running container.

docker attach â€“ Connects your terminal directly to a containerâ€™s output.

docker commit â€“ it  Creates a new image from an existing container's state.

docker cp â€“ Copies files or folders between host and container.

docker stats â€“ Displays live CPU, memory, and network usage of containers.

docker top â€“ Lists running processes inside a container.

docker start â€“ Starts a stopped container.

docker pause â€“ Suspends all processes in a container.

docker unpause â€“ Resumes a paused container.

docker rename â€“ Renames an existing container.

docker wait â€“ Waits for a container to stop, then prints its exit code.

docker attach â€“ (Again) Attaches terminal to a running container .

docker port â€“ Shows the public-facing port mapped to the container's port.

docker update â€“ Changes resource limits (like memory ) for a container.

docker restart â€“ Stops and starts a container in one step.

Steps completed to practice Docker volume usage, image pulling, container management, and serving custom HTML pages using nginx and httpd.

Steps Completed
1. Created Docker Volume
Command used:
docker volume create my_volume
â†’ Created a named volume my_volume to persist data across containers.

2. Ran Nginx Container with Volume Mount
Command used:
docker run -d --name nginx-container -p 8080:80 -v my_volume:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
â†’ Started an Nginx container and mounted my_volume to serve HTML content.

3. Verified Default Nginx Page
â†’ Opened http://localhost:8080 in the browser to see the Nginx default welcome page.

4. Created index.html
â†’ A custom HTML file named index.html was created on the host machine with sample content.

5. Copied index.html into Container
Command used:
docker cp index.html nginx-container:/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
â†’ Replaced the default Nginx page with the custom index.html file.

6. Verified Custom Page on Nginx
â†’ Refreshed http://localhost:8080 to confirm that the new custom page was displayed.

7. Stopped and Removed Nginx Container
Commands used:
docker stop nginx-container
docker rm nginx-container
â†’ Stopped and removed the Nginx container after testing.

8. Ran HTTPD  Container with Same Volume
Command used:
docker run -d --name httpd-container -p 8081:80 -v my_volume:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs httpd
â†’ Started an Apache container with the same volume to test reusability.

9. Verified Default HTTPD Page
â†’ Opened http://localhost:8081 in the browser to view the Apache default page.

10. Created about.html
â†’ Created another HTML file named about.html on the host machine with sample content.

11. Copied about.html into HTTPD Container
Command used:
docker cp about.html httpd-container:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/about.html
â†’ Added the new file to the shared volume for the Apache container to serve.

12. Verified Custom About Page
â†’ Opened http://localhost:8081/about.html in the browser and confirmed the page was accessible.

13. Stopped and Removed HTTPD Container
Commands used:
docker stop httpd-container
docker rm httpd-container
â†’ Cleaned up the HTTPD container after testing.

14. Verified Volume Content
Command used:
docker run --rm -v my_volume:/data busybox ls /data
â†’ Verified that both index.html and about.html were still in the volume.

15. Removed Volume
Command used:
docker volume rm my_volume
â†’ Removed the volume after testing was complete.
